----------Features-----------

    Predicts vehicle mileage based on input features such as mpg,cylinders,displacement,horsepower,weights etc.
    Utilizes various machine learning algorithms (Polynomial regression, Linear Regression, Random forest regression).
    Visualizations of data and model performance metrics.
--------------Data-----------
    The dataset used for training the model is 'https://github.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/raw/main/MPG.csv . 
------------- Model Training-------------
    To train the model, run the following command: python milage_prediction.py This will preprocess the data and train the model using the specified algorithms.

-----------Results----------------
The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
